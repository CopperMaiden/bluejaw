# BLUEJAW
Multi-client Bluetooth sharing device with a mass of QOL features, all packed into the size of an Altoids tin

Hello !
To clear up any confusion, 0x29 is just one of my aliases. This device is of my own design, yet I'm flexible regarding the public's consumption or adaptations of it. Open source is love <3.

This project is dedicated to my partner and made possible by the HackClub organization. (WEBSITE: https://hackclub.com/, © 2026 Hack Club. 501(c)(3) nonprofit (EIN: 81-2908499))
